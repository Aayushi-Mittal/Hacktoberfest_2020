# 2D Array - Alternating rectangles of O and X
Write a code which inputs two numbers m and n and creates a matrix of size m x n (m rows and n columns) in which every elements is either X or 0. The Xs and 0s must be filled alternatively, the matrix should have outermost rectangle of Xs, then a rectangle of 0s, then a rectangle of Xs, and so on.. 

### Input Format
You need to tell that how many rows and columns your matrix need to have and these values should be separated by space.
### Constraints
1 <= n,m <= 1000
### Output Format
Print the resultant matrix to the stdout.
